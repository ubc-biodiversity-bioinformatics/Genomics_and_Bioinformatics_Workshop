## Intro to bioinformatics
### Learning Objectives:
By the end of this workshop you should be able to:
- Describe the different types of sequencing that exist 
- Explain the pros and cons of these types of sequencing 
- Understand what would be the best types of sequencing for a given project objective

<!-- Sequencing types -->
## Sequencing types

|Sequencing name | Type | Usage | Pros | Cons | Case study reference| 
|----------------|------|-------|------|------|---------------------|
| Sanger sequencing (1st generation)|  | can target specific genes | | | | 
| DNA Barcoding | PCR or  Next generation sequencing (Illumina short read) | identify species in a sample of mixed species based on a previously compiled database of barcodes| | | | 
| Microsatellites or ribosomal, plastid or mitochondial markers (rbcL, matK, ITS, trnH-psbA, and ycf1) | PCR?  | identify species in a sample of mixed species or low resolution population comparisons | | | | 
| Whole genome sequencing (WGS) | Next generation sequencing (Illumina short read) | sequencing of the whole genome with short reads | better coverage of the genome | | |
| Reduced representation sequencing (GBS or RADseq) | Next generation sequencing (Illumina short read) | sequencing a random but consistient subset of the genome, used for high resolution population genomics | Cheaper than WGS| | |
| Poolseq | Next generation sequencing (Illumina short read) | grouping of individuals into pools before sequencing | | | |
| Oxford Nanopore (ONT)| Long read sequencing (3rd generation)  | Chromosome level genome assemblies | Cheaper than HiFi, Long reads allow for better assemblies | Higher error rate than HiFi and Illumina | Ref | 
| PacBio HiFi| Long read sequencing (3rd generation) | Chromosome level genome assemblies  |  | | |
| Methylseq or WGBS | Next generation sequencing (Illumina short read) | Methylation sequencing |  | | |
| HiC | Next generation sequencing (Illumina short read) | 3D DNA structure to aid in genome assemblies | | | |
